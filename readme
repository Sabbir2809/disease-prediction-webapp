# Multiple Disease Predictor

## About

This is a Web-based Project which Predicts the Diseases of Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Heart, Kidney, and Liver. This project is about a medical testing website that uses machine learning to generate predictions about various diseases. The following diseases can be predicted using the webapp:

- Diabetes
- Breast Cancer
- Heart Disease
- Kidney Disease
- Liver Disease


## Application
- To Remove the Dependencies on the Doctors.
- To Help out the Poor and Helpless People with the Normal Medical Checkup.
- To Help People avoid paying huge amount to the Doctors Unnecessarily.
- To Extend the Role of the Technology in the Medical Field.

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Diabetes       | Machine Learning Model   | 98.25%   |
| Breast Cancer  | Machine Learning Model   | 98.25%   |
| Heart Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 85.25%   |
| Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model   | 99%      |
| Liver Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 78%      |
